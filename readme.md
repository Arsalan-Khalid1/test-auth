This project is as basic as it can get, as you mentioned it should be basic so here it is.

To start this project just run "npm start for frontend" and  "npm run dev" for backend

it has 3 endpoints

"/login", "/register", "/reset-password"


I can show you my real projects if this basic-est version doesn't satisfy you

let's meet in the interview
